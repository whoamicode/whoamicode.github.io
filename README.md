"Who am I, code?" is an initiative to help anyone to start a project without afraid off.

### Who this project is for

So ... anyone, but I think this project can help in different ways depending on the need and the knowledge level.

For example:

- Beginners on the software development world can use to understand how they can create a basic project using a usual structure (Docker, Continuous integration with a basic pipeline, integration with Github, etc)

- Another one can use this project to test something as if your local environment is working well or whatever they need.

- So... or if only is needing to save time during the creation of a basic project.

Doesn't matter the necessity. What we're considering essential is that this project helps someone for something.

## About the initiative 

This initiative is composed of some project that works similarly. The purpose is that the only change is the codebase.  

For now, we have these projects working
- [Node](https://github.com/marcopollivier/whoaminode)
- [Go](https://github.com/marcopollivier/whoamigo)

This in WIP status 
- [Clojure](https://github.com/marcopollivier/whoamiclojure)

And this to the future
- [Java](https://github.com/marcopollivier/whoamivertx)

These projects there're in common: 
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) as a container manager;
- [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/marcopollivier/whoami) as the registry to the image;
- [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/product/#how-it-works) as the Continuous Integration manager; 
- [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github) as the Git client and host.



So... this doc is a WIP work... we'll update it soon with more information. See you :)
